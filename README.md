# Pacopolis Electronic Voting System
# Software 361 Capstone Project

Welcome to the Pacopolis Electronic System Project! This system is being developed as part of a software engineering course by our team of contributors: Shane, Estefany, Clara, Dom, and Jake. 

Project Overview
The City of Pacopolis has tasked us with developing an electronic voting system to facilitate various elections and decision making processes. While the mayoral race between Pat Mann and Dawn Keykong is the primary focus, there are also other elections and issues that need to be addressed. Our system aims to be robust and scalable to accommodate future elections as well. 

Features
•	Authentication: The system allows voters to identify themselves securely.
•	Ballot Presentation: Voters are presented with the ballot after authentication.
•	Selection and Review: Voters can make selections and review/change them before submission.
•	Vote Recording: Once submitted, the voter's choices are securely recorded.
•	Prevention of Duplicate Voting: The system prohibits a voter from voting more than once in the same election.
•	Election Outcome Determination: At the end of the voting day, the system determines the winner of each election and the outcome of each issue.
•	Privacy Protection: While voters can verify their recorded votes, and third parties can confirm whether a particular voter voted, the system ensures voter anonymity by preventing third parties from determining how any particular voter voted.
•	Accessibility: The system allows an unlimited number of voters to vote from their own computers or from shared computers at polling locations.
